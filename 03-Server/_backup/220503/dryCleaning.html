               <h1> What is Dry Cleaning and How does it Work? | LG Styler </h1>
               <p>Have you ever wanted to refresh and sanitize your clothes or bedding without taking them to the dry cleaners for a deeper clean? Or perhaps you wondered whether dry cleaning was needed to reduce odours or wrinkles? Do special care instructions on delicate pieces leave you mystified and intimidated? Well, worry not! In this article we’ll break down what dry cleaning is for, how it works, and how you can refresh your delicate clothes and hard-to-wash pieces from the comfort of your home. </p>

               <h2>Dry Cleaning Definition and Process </h2>
               <p>Let’s start from the beginning, what is dry cleaning exactly? The term itself can be a bit misleading. Dry cleaning technically refers to any cleaning process in which a solvent other than water is used. Certain fabrics such as silk, cashmere, wool, leather, and many more can be damaged or prone to shrinkage when treated with water. That’s why dry cleaning is important to extend the lifespan of your favorite (and often expensive) clothing items. Commercial dry cleaners often use a chemical solvent such as perchloroethylene instead of water. This solvent acts as a ‘spotting agent’ to help penetrate fabrics and remove stains in a more concentrated way than a normal machine wash. However, chemical solvents like this can leave residue on clothes which may even lead to fabric damage over time. They are also often toxic and damaging to the environment, leading to increased focus on alternative methods of dry cleaning in recent years. </p>

               <h2>Home Alternatives to Clothing Care</h2>
               <p>If you’re looking for a non-chemical way to care for your delicate garments while also hoping to avoid the hassle of hand-washing, the <a href="https://youtu.be/pFJcnZjjg9E" class="anchor_txt" title="https://youtu.be/pFJcnZjjg9E" data-link-area="LG Styler Hero Video | LG Canada" data-link-name="LG Styler Hero Video | LG Canada">LG Styler</a> has you covered. By using the power of steam to gently sanitize and refresh your garments, the LG Styler makes the process of caring for certain delicate fabrics, from suits and school uniforms to wool jumpers and cashmere knitwear, quick and effortless. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="txt_wrap">
               <p>Here’s how to use it: </p>
               <p>1. First, it’s important to check the labels on your clothes to find the recommended washing method. This will usually provide you with more information about the fabric composition as well. The LG Styler even has a cycle* specifically made to care for delicate clothing items such as: </p>
               <ul class="sequence">
                  <li>Silks** </li>
                  <li>Wool and knitwear</li>
                  <li>Cashmere</li>
                  <li>Leather and Suede **</li>
                  <li>Business suits</li>
                  <li>Dress shirts and pants</li>
                  <li>Cotton and down jackets</li>
               </ul>
               <span>* Supported cycles may vary by model.</span>
               <span>**Leather or silk items should only be treated with the Air Fresh cycle. Supported cycles may vary by model.</span>
            </div>
            <p>2. Place the clothing items you wish to refresh into the Styler. </p>
            <p> 3. Select your desired cycle from the 4 cycles displayed: refresh, special care, air fresh, sanitize, and gentle dry*. <span>*Supported cycles may vary by model. </span>
            </p>
            <p>4. Styler cycles range from 20 minutes to over an hour depending on the cycle chosen. Once the selected cycle finishes, simply take your fresh, ready-to-wear clothes out of the Styler.</p>
