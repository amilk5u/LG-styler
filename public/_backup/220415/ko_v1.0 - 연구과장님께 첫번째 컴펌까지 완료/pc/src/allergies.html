               <strong>Seasonal Allergies <br> Symptoms and Treatment</strong>
               <p>Most people look forward to the change of seasons. The days get longer, the leaves change colors, flowers bloom, and the weather gets warmer. As nice as it sounds in theory, many people suffer during the transition into these warmer months. Seasonal allergies are the source of many a runny nose or itchy eyes, but exactly what are allergies?</p>
               <p>According to the Asthma Canada Foundation, allergies occur or flare up when allergens, usually pollen or other environmental substances, enter your body causing an immune system response. An allergy that occurs more in a specific season is commonly referred to as “hay fever.” The term hay fever originated from hay cutting season, traditionally in the summer months. As you can imagine, this hay cutting resulted in more airborne allergens and an influx of allergy symptoms. While spring and summer are certainly the peak, it’s possible to suffer from seasonal allergies year-round. Let’s roll up our sleeves and dig in to the symptoms, causes, and treatments for seasonal allergies.</p>

               <strong>Symptoms of Seasonal Allergies</strong>
               <p>Seasonal allergies can present themselves in many different ways. Probably the first thing people think of and associate with seasonal allergies is sneezing. It makes sense, your body is attempting to rid itself of the allergens irritating your airways. It’s common for people with asthma to have asthma attacks triggered by seasonal allergens if they have seasonal allergies as well. The most common symptoms of hay fever are:</p>

               <li>Sneezing</li>

               <li>Nasal congestion</li>
               <li>Itchy, irrigated eyes</li>
               <li>Itchy throat and ears</li>
               <li>Clogged ears</li>
               <li>Headache</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While the symptoms may present themselves in many different ways depending on the person, the causes of seasonal allergies are pretty easy to pinpoint.</p>

               <strong>Causes of Seasonal Allergies</strong>
               <p>As we mentioned in the beginning of this article, though hay fever is most commonly associated with the spring and summer months, seasonal allergies can affect people year-round. Let’s take a look at the different causes of Seasonal Allergies throughout the year.</p>
            </div>
            <ul class="sequence">
               <li><em>Spring</em> : The most common culprit causing seasonal allergies are trees! Though the flowering blossoms may be beautiful to look at in the spring, chances are they are the root of your pain. Tree pollen is a well-known allergen and usually peaks in late April or early May. Next time you stop to appreciate the flowers, maybe think twice!</li>
               <li><em>Summer</em> : Summer is the season during which the name hay fever originated, and the most common allergen is, once again, pollen. The source of this pollen is different from the spring months though, and it’s usually grass pollen that triggers people’s seasonal allergies. The peak for this kind of allergen runs from late May to about mid-July. </li>
               <li><em>Fall</em> : As the days get colder in the autumn, many of the sources of allergens start to die, resulting in fewer instances of hay fever. However, one thing that can still trigger seasonal allergies during this season is ragweed. Ragweed only lives for one season, but during this time, ragweed pollen is still potent enough to cause an unwanted bout of sneezing. Ragweed season usually lasts from mid to late August, and peters out in October.</li>
               <li><em>Winter</em> : By the time winter rolls around, most outdoor plants, and their resulting allergens are dormant. However, during the winter, due to increased hours spent indoors, those prone to seasonal allergies may find themselves suffering from indoor allergies. Things such as mold, dust, and pet dander are common indoor allergens that may trigger symptoms even in the winter. </li>

               <strong>Treating Seasonal Allergies and LG Styler</strong>
               <p>Now that we’ve covered what seasonal allergies are, what allergens are responsible for causing them, and what kind of symptoms seasonal allergies can cause, let’s finally get to ways you can treat them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="txt_wrap">
               <ul class="sequence">
                  <li>The first fix for sufferers of seasonal allergies is pretty simple – stay inside! Taking steps to avoid the worst times and days for known allergens like pollen is one of the best ways to avoid symptoms. Check your local weather forecast and try and keep indoors as much as possible on days that show a high pollen count in the air. </li>
                  <li>Keep your doors and windows shut in the morning and early afternoon to avoid outdoor irritants being carried into your house with the breeze. Pollen counts usually peak around mid-day and are lowest before dawn and in the early evening. So, if you want to open your windows for fresh air, these are the best times to do so without suffering from allergies!</li>
                  <li>Another option to keep your allergies in check is disinfecting your clothes, bedding, and more with LG Styler. Not many people want to become a recluse for the entirety of spring, summer and fall. For those who want to venture outside, and still keep their allergies at bay, LG Styler is a great solution</li>

               <p>What many people don’t notice is that when they go outside, they’re bringing a lot of the peskiest irritants and allergens back home. Things like pollen can easily coat your jacket, meaning that even when you escape the outdoor air for the comfort and cleanliness of home, seasonal allergens may still be lurking! That’s why it’s important to properly disinfect the clothes that you wear outside, especially during hay fever season. Luckily, the LG Styler is perfect for getting all of the dirt, pollen, and dust you might have picked up over the course of the day off of your garments!</p>

               <strong>Hake off all kinds of pollens and dust mites by Moving Hanger</strong>
               <p>One other function that keeps those pesky outside pollutant off your clothes is the Moving Hanger function!
