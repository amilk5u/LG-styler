         <strong>How To Dry Clean <br> Clothes Easily At Home.</strong>
         <p>There is confusion about the meaning of dry cleaning. Let's find out what dry cleaning is, how it works and how to dry clean at home with LG Styler.</p>
         <p>Have you ever skipped dry cleaning clothes or bedding because it’s simply too much hassle? Or perhaps you wondered why dry cleaning is so important anyway. Do “dry-clean” only clothes leave you mystified and slightly intimidated? Yeah, we’ve all been there. That’s why in this article we’ll not only break down what dry cleaning is, but also how it works. Best of all, we’ll walk you through the process of dry-cleaning clothes from the comfort of home, effectively taking the hassle and stress out of dry-cleaning clothes. </p>

         <strong>What is dry cleaning and how does it work?</strong>
         <p>Let’s start from the beginning, what is dry cleaning exactly? To start off, the term itself can be a bit misleading. Dry cleaning technically refers to any cleaning process in which a solvent other than water is used. Certain fabrics such as silk, cashmere, wool, leather, and many more can be damaged or shrunk when treated with water. That’s why dry cleaning is important to extend the lifespan of your favorite (and often priciest) clothing items. Commercial dry cleaners often use a chemical solvent such as perchloroethylene instead of water. This solvent acts as a ‘spotting agent’ to help penetrate fabrics and remove stains in a more focused way than a normal machine wash. However, chemical solvents like this can leave residue on clothes which may even lead to fabric damage over time. Chemicals like these are also often toxic and damaging to the environment, leading to increased focus on alternative methods of dry cleaning in recent years</p>

      <p> 4. Each cycle takes between 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete. Once the cycle finishes, simply take your fresh, <br> ready-to-wear clothes out of the Styler. </p>
